1. Generative vs Discriminative Algorithms

Let's say you have input data `x` and you want to classify the data into labels `y`. A generative model learns the **joint** probability distribution `p(x,y)` and a discriminative model learns the **conditional** probability distribution `p(y|x)` - which you should read as *"the probability of `y` given `x`"*.

Here's a really simple example. Suppose you have the following data in the form `(x,y)`:

`(1,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2, 1)`

`p(x,y)` is

          y=0   y=1
         -----------
    x=1 | 1/2   0
    x=2 | 1/4   1/4

`p(y|x)` is

          y=0   y=1
         -----------
    x=1 | 1     0
    x=2 | 1/2   1/2


If you take a few minutes to stare at those two matrices, you will understand the difference between the two probability distributions.

The distribution `p(y|x)` is the natural distribution for classifying a given example `x` into a class `y`, which is why algorithms that model this directly are called discriminative algorithms. Generative algorithms model `p(x,y)`, which can be transformed into `p(y|x)` by applying Bayes rule and then used for classification. However, the distribution `p(x,y)` can also be used for other purposes. For example, you could use `p(x,y)` to *generate* likely `(x,y)` pairs.

From the description above, you might be thinking that generative models are more generally useful and therefore better, but it's not as simple as that. [This paper][1] is a very popular reference on the subject of discriminative vs. generative classifiers, but it's pretty heavy going. The overall gist is that discriminative models generally outperform generative models in classification tasks.
